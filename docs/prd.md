### Use Case 2: Real-Time Inflation Tracking
**Actor:** Economic Researcher
**Goal:** Monitor real-time retail price changes between BLS releases
**Scenario:** Researcher sets up alerts for when retailer price changes exceed 0.5pp difference from last BLS release, receives notifications when significant divergences occur.

### Use Case 3: Category-Specific Analysis
**Actor:** Business Intelligence Analyst
**Goal:** Analyze pricing trends across different product categories
**Scenario:** Analyst selects multiple BLS product categories (milk, cheese, bread, ground beef), compares retailer pricing patterns across categories to identify which product groups show consistent pricing alignment or divergence.

### Use Case 4: Geographic Price Variation Analysis
**Actor:** Policy Researcher
**Goal:** Understand regional price differences relative to national BLS data
**Scenario:** Researcher compares retailer pricing in different metro areas (Minneapolis, Chicago, Los Angeles) against national BLS averages to identify regional inflation patterns.

### Use Case 5: Automated Data Export for Research
